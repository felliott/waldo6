=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements a HTTP REST API to the corp database tables related to clients.

The API uses JSON for data encoding and uses the Hypertext Application Language
(HAL) media type "application/hal+json". For more information see:

    http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html

Using HAL enables the use of a generic interactive "browser" for the API.
A HAL browser is bundled with the API and the supplied webapi-dbic.psgi.
Simply navigate to the root URL of the API with a web browser to access the
"HAL browser".

See data_service_api.pod for (much) more detail.

=head1 TODO

Vague thoughts for consideration, in no particular order:

    Refactor WebAPI::DBIC::WebApp
    - move HAL browser out somewhere and mount via .psgi file
    - move/rethink My::HTTP::Throwable::Factory package block
    - move mk_generic_dbic_item_set_routes out to new module
    Leave just calls to mk_generic_dbic_item_set_routes and the construction
    of Path::Router - though even that could be moved to a better home.

    Reconsider using or removing unused code from WebAPI::DBIC::Util
    (I think only create_header is used at the moment)

    Better error reporting (in HAL format)
    Reconsider and/or polish HTTP::Throwable::Role::JSONBody
    Handle and report parameter validation and db constraint errors in a way that
    allows sufficient information to be returned to the caller e.g., to mark which
    fields of a web form hold invalid values.

    improve partial response support for prefetch (post DBIx::Class upgrade)

    use HAL CURIE prefix in link keys

    limit fields returned by default - add to the code on demand, so we know the
    fields are actually being used and the inverse, that we can remove/change a
    field that's not being exposed and know that no users of the api will be affected.
    Perhaps allow DBIC resultset classes to define what default set of fields to use.

    Refactor param handling to abstract ~json both for requests *and* constructing
    link urls (where json data isn't fully handled at the moment, other than pass-thru).

    Refactor transaction handling.

    Update HAL browser:
    git subtree pull --squash --prefix hal-browser git@github.com:mikekelly/hal-browser.git master
